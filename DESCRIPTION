Description: The iterLap (iterated Laplace approximation) algorithm approximates a
             general (possibly non-normalized) probability density on R^p, by repeated
             Laplace approximations to the difference between current approximation 
             and true density (on log scale). The final approximation is a mixture of
             multivariate normal distributions and might be used for example as a
             proposal distribution for importance sampling (eg in Bayesian applications). 
             The algorithm can be seen as a computational generalization of the Laplace 
             approximation suitable for skew or multimodal densities.
